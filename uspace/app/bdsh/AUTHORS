Written by Tim Post <echo@echoreply.us> to serve as a primitive shell
for HelenOS, or as a template to make a command line interface that
offers shell like creature comforts.

This program was mostly written from scratch, some existing code was
used from other various free software projects:

* Based on the HelenOS testing sub-system written by Martin Decky

* read_line() (input.c) was written by Jiri Svoboda
