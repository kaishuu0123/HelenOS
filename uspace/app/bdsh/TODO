This is a very brain dead shell. It needs some love, coffee or perhaps beer.
Currently, you can't even really call it a shell, its more of a CLI that
offers some shell like creature comforts.

This was written in a hurry to provide some means of testing persistent file
systems in HelenOS. It does its job, its nowhere near complete but it is
actively developed. If your reading this, its likely that you're looking for
some functionality that is not yet present. Prior to filing a bug report,
please make sure that what you want is not on the list below.

A list of things to do:
-----------------------

* rm: add support for recursively removing directories and files therein

* Port an editor (vim?)

* Finish cat / cp

* Support basic redirection (i.e ls > foo.txt)

* Expand wildcards (i.e. *.txt), don't worry about variables for now

* Basic scripting

* Hash previously found commands

* Improve input, add history / etc (port libedit?)

* Add wrappers for signal, sigaction to make ports to modules easier

Regarding POSIX:
----------------
POSIX is a standard for Unix-like operating systems. HelenOS is (mostly) just
a kernel at this point with a few userspace programs that facilitate testing
of the kernel and file systems.

HelenOS is not a Unix-like operating system. HelenOS is its own thing, a modern
microkernel OS and many directions are not yet set.

Please do not e-mail me to point out that modular implementations that resemble
typical core utilities do not conform to some POSIX standard, these are temporary
and serve the useful purpose of testing persistent file systems.
