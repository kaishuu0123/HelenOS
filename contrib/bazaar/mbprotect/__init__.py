"""Main Branch Protection plugin for Bazaar."""

#
# This plugin employs the pre_change_branch_tip hook to protect the main
# branch (a.k.a. linear history) of bzr repositories from unwanted change,
# effectively making the main branch append-only.
#
# Specifically we verify that the new main branch contains the old tip.
# This prevents a branch from inadvertently aquiring the tip of another branch.
#
# Install this plugin in ~/.bazaar/plugins/mbprotect
#
# See also http://trac.helenos.org/trac.fcgi/wiki/BazaarWorkflow
