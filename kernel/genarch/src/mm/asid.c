/**
 * @file
 * @brief ASID management.
 *
 * Modern processor architectures optimize TLB utilization
 * by using ASIDs (a.k.a. memory contexts on sparc64 and
 * region identifiers on ia64). These ASIDs help to associate
 * each TLB item with an address space, thus making
 * finer-grained TLB invalidation possible.
 *
 * Unfortunatelly, there are usually less ASIDs available than
 * there can be unique as_t structures (i.e. address spaces
 * recognized by the kernel).
 *
 * When system runs short of ASIDs, it will attempt to steal
 * ASID from an address space that has not been active for
 * a while.
 *
 * This code depends on the fact that ASIDS_ALLOCABLE
 * is greater than number of supported CPUs (i.e. the
 * amount of concurently active address spaces).
 *
 * Architectures that don't have hardware support for address
 * spaces do not compile with this file.
