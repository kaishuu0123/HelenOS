/* IPC resources management
 *
 * The goal of this source code is to properly manage IPC resources and allow
 * straight and clean clean-up procedure upon task termination.
 *
 * The pattern of usage of the resources is:
 * - allocate empty phone slot, connect | deallocate slot
 * - disconnect connected phone (some messages might be on the fly)
 * - find phone in slot and send a message using phone
 * - answer message to phone
 * - hangup phone (the caller has hung up)
 * - hangup phone (the answerbox is exiting)
 *
 * Locking strategy
 *
 * - To use a phone, disconnect a phone etc., the phone must be first locked and
 *   then checked that it is connected
 * - To connect an allocated phone it need not be locked (assigning pointer is
 *   atomic on all platforms)
 *
 * - To find an empty phone slot, the TASK must be locked
 * - To answer a message, the answerbox must be locked
 * - The locking of phone and answerbox is done at the ipc_ level.
 *   It is perfectly correct to pass unconnected phone to these functions and
 *   proper reply will be generated.
 *
 * Locking order
 *
 * - first phone, then answerbox
 *   + Easy locking on calls
 *   - Very hard traversing list of phones when disconnecting because the phones
 *     may disconnect during traversal of list of connected phones. The only
 *     possibility is try_lock with restart of list traversal.
 *
 * Destroying is less frequent, this approach is taken.
 *
 * Phone call
 *
 * *** Connect_me_to ***
 * The caller sends IPC_M_CONNECT_ME_TO to an answerbox. The server receives
 * 'phoneid' of the connecting phone as an ARG5. If it answers with RETVAL=0,
 * the phonecall is accepted, otherwise it is refused.
 *
 * *** Connect_to_me ***
 * The caller sends IPC_M_CONNECT_TO_ME. 
 * The server receives an automatically opened phoneid. If it accepts
 * (RETVAL=0), it can use the phoneid immediately. 
 * Possible race condition can arise, when the client receives messages from new
 * connection before getting response for connect_to_me message. Userspace
 * should implement handshake protocol that would control it.
 *
 * Phone hangup
 *
 * *** The caller hangs up (sys_ipc_hangup) ***
 * - The phone is disconnected (no more messages can be sent over this phone),
 *   all in-progress messages are correctly handled. The answerbox receives
 *   IPC_M_PHONE_HUNGUP call from the phone that hung up. When all async
 *   calls are answered, the phone is deallocated.
 *
 * *** The answerbox hangs up (ipc_answer(EHANGUP))
 * - The phone is disconnected. EHANGUP response code is sent
 *   to the calling task. All new calls through this phone
 *   get a EHUNGUP error code, the task is expected to
 *   send an sys_ipc_hangup after cleaning up its internal structures.
 *
 * Call forwarding
 *
 * The call can be forwarded, so that the answer to call is passed directly
 * to the original sender. However, this poses special problems regarding 
 * routing of hangup messages.
 *
 * sys_ipc_hangup -> IPC_M_PHONE_HUNGUP
 * - this message CANNOT be forwarded
 *
 * EHANGUP during forward
 * - The *forwarding* phone will be closed, EFORWARD is sent to receiver.
 *
 * EHANGUP, ENOENT during forward
 * - EFORWARD is sent to the receiver, ipc_forward returns error code EFORWARD
 *
 * Cleanup strategy
 *
 * 1) Disconnect all our phones ('ipc_phone_hangup').
 *
 * 2) Disconnect all phones connected to answerbox.
 *
 * 3) Answer all messages in 'calls' and 'dispatched_calls' queues with
 *    appropriate error code (EHANGUP, EFORWARD).
 *
 * 4) Wait for all async answers to arrive and dispose of them.
